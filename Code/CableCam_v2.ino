 *    This code is to be loaded onto your Thing ESP8266 board.
 *    You'll need to insert the auth code generated by the Blynk app
 *    into line 37, char auth[]. You'll also need to insert your
 *    network name and password into Blynk.begin, line 46.
 *    
 *    This code is public domain, but if you find it useful, and we
 *    meet at the local someday, you buy me a beer (Beerware License).
